    Being a Concept Artist's always been the
    goal. Always.
    Growing up, video games were a major
    part of what shaped
    my interests. Those interests carried over to my ambitions, and those ambitions are now my goals. Being able to
    create different worlds out of nothing but your imagination always left me in wonder. Playing Fantasy games
    like Final Fantasy and Chrono Trigger are the main inspiration for the art I work on today, with heavy influences
    from artists such as Instagram personalities <a href="https://www.instagram.com/joshcorpuzart/?hl=en">Josh Corpuz</a>
    and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/vonnart/?hl=en">Vonnart</a>. The result of all
    those influences is a darker, more gritty feel which is the emphasis of the pieces I work on. Being able to one
    day
    create my own universe synonymous with my brand is where I hope to be.</p>

    &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I
    specialize in more
    static
    works, <img class="aboutphoto2" src="images/8.jpg" align="right" alt="">
    <br>
    <br>
    such as
    Illustrations and
    landscaping. I've worked with
    multiple different mediums but my main selling point is being able to put out highly detailed inked pieces with a
    variety of greyscale mediums, such as ink, graphite, digital, etc. I've experimented with a variety of traditional
    mediums, such as pastels, acrylics, and other types of paint, but are not my strong suit. </p>
